            <p>More than 10 years ago, at a corner of a Bellevue middle school cafeteria, a few parents of Chinese Americans 
               after dropping off their kids to the Saturday Chinese language porgam, often sit together and brainstormed on 
               how to bridge cultural gaps for young generations.  As the result, CE was born in 2000 and started offering Greater Seattle area 
               teachers a 2-weeks long summer trip each year to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  As we established into an 
               independent non-profit organization in 2008, we also expanded our efforts to other activity in a hope to 
               promote a better understanding of Chinese culture and language.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Today we are happy to announce our sixth annual Washington State Chinese Language and Talent Competition with 
               Qualification Events for “Chinese Bridge” Chinese Proficiency Competition. All K-12 students in this state 
               from public and private schools as well as students from Chinese heritage schools and home tutoring institutes 
               are welcome to participate.  We hope this event will provide a venue where students with diverse cultural background 
               can come together to share their knowledge and experience.</p>
