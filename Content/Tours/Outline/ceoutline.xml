            <b>Managed Tour:</b> A commercially managed sightseeing tour to historical landmarks such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City and the Terra Cotta Warriors 
            and visits to modern cities such as Shanghai and Taipei. It is customized for CE, fast-paced and well structured. The tour guides provide

            <b>Local Host Family:</b> Host-family sponsored programs provide opportunities to interact with Chinese families, teachers and students on an informal basis. 
            Unlike the sightseeing tour, this emphasizes the understanding of modern day Chinese family living, school systems and cultural exchange. This includes school 
            visits in Beijing, Shanghai and Taipei. The participating teachers will have an opportunity to exchange teaching philosophies with Chinese educators and 
            conduct teaching demonstration in local schools.

            <b>Logistics:</b> Summer in these parts of Asia is extremely hot and humid. Average temperatures easily reach 100 F with 50% or
            greater humidity. A typical day during the trip involves 12 to 14 hours of activities including travel from place to place on a
            tour bus. Consideration for the physical and mental preparedness, key to a successful trip in a foreign land, is
            highly encouraged.
