            <b>Competition Class 比赛分级:</b> 
            <br/>
            Please note that there are three classes for Individual Language-Based competitions (i.e. Individual Poetry Recitation 个人诗歌朗诵, Story Telling说故事 and Public Speaking演讲). The Competition Class is based on the contestant’s individual language ability (not based on the contestant’s family background or birth or origin). Individual Language-Based competitions are intended for students who are learning Chinese as a second language. We ask that students who studied in schools in Chinese speaking countries and still speak Chinese as a primary language now not sign up. <br/><br/>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Class A:</b> This class is intended to challenge students with advanced Chinese skills (or the champion from the B Class last year). It is designed for students who can communicate in Chinese fluently with very little foreign accent.  Students who lived or vacationed in Chinese speaking countries, or in addition to school, still have the opportunity to communicate with others such as parents, relatives, or friends in Chinese may compete in this class.</li><br/>
               Please take note that the champion of class A from last year will not be eligible for the competition in class A. Please refer details in the following Restrictions of Qualification section for other classes.<br/> <br/>
              <li><b>Class B:</b> This class is designated for students whose Chinese proficiency is at intermediate level (or the champion from the C Class last year). Students who communicate well in Chinese but carry an accent in a way that people can recognize as a second-language learner may compete in this class.  </li>
              <li><b>Class C:</b> TThis class is designed for students whose Chinese proficiency is at beginner level.  Students who are not yet able to perform complex communicative tasks in Chinese and still find oral presentation a challenge are encouraged to compete under this class. </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            *** Please note that the judges have the right to promote students whose Chinese language skills are much higher 
            than expected for Class B/C to again compete in Class A/B and the scores that they earned in Class A/B will be voided. 
            <br/><br/>
            *** For those students who are not sure about which class to register, please consult with their Chinese language
            teachers or contact the event organizer using the Contact Information below.  The list of students who are promoted
            to compete in Class A will be posted at the administrative office.  Please be sure to check the list after
            completion of the event. Please kindly respect the judges’ decision.<br/>

            <b>Competition Restriction 比赛资格限制</b> <br>
	    <ul>
	    <li>The champions (individual or team) from last year are not eligible to sign up for the same competition (with an exception of China Knowledge Bowl) at the same grade or class until there is at least one year of separation.  China Knowledge Bowl participants regardless of their places the year before can sign up at the same level based on the grade level.  The rest of Champions are encouraged to skip or jump to the next level of challenge such as instead of Class B sign up for Class A or instead of Grades K-2, sign up for Grades 3-5, etc...</i><br>
            <li>In a team competition, students at a lower grade level can join the team at a higher grade, i.e. Grades K-2 students can join a Grades 3-5 team, but not vice versa, i.e. Grades 3-5 students cannot join a Grades K-2 team.</i><br>
            <li>No contestant can compete in the same category more than once (except for the Poetry Recitation). For example, if a contestant signs up to compete individually or with a group in the Singing competition (歌唱比赛), he/she cannot sign up to compete again even as a background singer or help with a musical instrument for another performer or group.  However, a student can compete once in Individual Poetry Recitation (个人诗歌朗诵) and another time in Team Poetry Recitation (团体诗歌朗诵).</i><br>
            <li>Please also note that any assistances or cues from the parents or teachers to the contestants while performing on the stage are strictly prohibited.  The violation of this rule will result in a disqualification.</i><br>
