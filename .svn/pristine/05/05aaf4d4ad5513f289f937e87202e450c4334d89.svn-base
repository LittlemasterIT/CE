            <p>More than 10 years ago, at a corner of a Bellevue middle school cafeteria, a few parents of Chinese Americans 
               after dropping off their kids to the Saturday Chinese language porgam, often sit together and brainstormed on 
               how to bridge cultural gaps for young generations.  As the result, CE was born in 2000 and started offering Greater Seattle area 
               teachers a 2-weeks long summer trip each year to China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  As we established into an 
               independent non-profit organization in 2008, we also expanded our efforts to other activity in a hope to 
               promote a better understanding of Chinese culture and language.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Today we are happy to announce our fourth annual Washington State Chinese Language and Talent Competition. All
               K-12 students in this state from public and private schools as well as students from Chinese heritage schools
               and home tutoring institutes are welcome to participate.  We hope this event will provide a venue where
               students with diverse cultural background can come together to share their knowledge and experience.</p>
