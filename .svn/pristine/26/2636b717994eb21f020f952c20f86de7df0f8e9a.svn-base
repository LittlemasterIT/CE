            Many thanks to our 2014 Tour particopating teachers that gave us valuable suggestions from their experiences.
            Their suggestions can be found in <a style="color:blue;" href="/content/resources/2014 suggestion on the Top Ten things to explore during CE tour V2.pdf" target="_blank">this document</a>.<br/><br/>
            In February, Coleen, CE 2013 Tour participating teacher, invited CE's director T.R. to her <i>Art Classroom Open House</i>.
            It was quite an experience for T.R. and CE. T.R. wrote up this <a style="color:blue;" href="/content/resources/2014 Trip Report to 2013 teacher Colleen's Art Classroom Open House.pdf" target="_blank">trip report</a>. Enjoy!<br/><br/>
            During CE annual luncheon, 2014 Tour participating teachers presented their experience in this <a style="color:blue;" href="/content/resources/2014 CE luncheon teachers presentation.ppt" target="_blank">PowerPoint Deck</a>.
            2014 talent competition participant, Nat, a 6th grader from Mercer International Middle School, told a story captured in this

              Riding on the belief that ‘the satisfaction of participating in volunteer work is priceless’, Jimmy has brought one of his expertise to 
              CE web site. Working with CE webmaster, Yvette Lee, and other CE core teams, Jimmy has redesigned CE web site with functions that are not 
              only easy for site maintenance and navigation, but also streamlining the online process for tour application and talent competition registration. 
              Thank you Jimmy for expanding our horizon!
