            <p>The Cultural Exploration(CE)of Greater China Foundation is a community-based non-profit organization dedicated to promote a
            better understanding of greater China and Chinese culture through education by offering cultural learning opportunities to
            schools or other educational institutions. In the past ten years, through generous donations from local communities and
            businesses, CE has sponsored over 40 teachers to tour China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. This year, through successful
            fund-raising, we are pleased to offer this great travel opportunity again to teachers that are enthusiastic about
            bringing China and Chinese culture to their classrooms.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Unlike other cultural exchange programs sponsored by various governments or academic organizations, CE is a community-based
            program. We believe that the most effective way to know modern day China, Chinese Culture and people is through pressure-free
            interpersonal interactions.</p>
